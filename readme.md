# Intro to Computational Science 125


* **Instructor:** Dan Neumnn, [daniel.neumann@indwes.edu](mailto:daniel.neumann@indwes.edu)

## Course Description

Coming soon

No computers provided in classroom. This is a BYOD course

## Prerequisites

* Registration in the course
* Ability to ask and answer questions
* Completion of the Math Competency requirement or permission of department.


These won't be enforced by the instructor, but you will be pretty lost without understanding those concepts.

## Course Overview

This course combines in class lectures with a supervised laboratory work weekly to teach an introduction to 
computer science including programming in a structured programming language. Special attention is given to the study 
of problem-solving processes in the context of algorithmic development. Programming topics include text processing, 
mathematical manipulation, array processing and code reading. Overview treatment of the history of computing and other 
general computer science topics like the binary numbering system, data storage, and operating systems will be covered. 

## Homework/Projects

All assignments are listed within the [Course Outline](#course-outline).

### Workflow

1. Fork the repository for the exercise/project (found under [github.com/advanced-js](https://github.com/advanced-js)).
1. Clone the repository to your computer.
1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser and open the Developer Tools.
1. Modify the files to complete your solution.
1. Refresh the `index.html` page to see the results, and repeat.
1. Make sure all of your code is committed.
1. Push/sync up to GitHub.
1. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) on the original repository. All assignments are due at the start of the following class, unless otherwise specified.
1. You can continue to push fixes and improvements until the close date (listed in Classes) – just add a comment in the pull request to let me know it's been updated.

        * Name
        * What you "do"
        * What are your goals for the class?
        * What's something in computer science (or technology) you worry that your peers understand but you don't?
1. Setup
    * Install GitHub for [Mac](https://mac.github.com) or [Windows](https://windows.github.com)
    * Sign up for GitHub
1. GitHub workflow
    * Walk through [workflow](#workflow)
    * Create pull request on [students repository](https://github.com/advanced-js/students)
1. Talk through [requirements](#homework-projects/requirements)
1. Explain how slides work
1. Get through `countdown_exercise` slide

#### Homework

* Read [JavaScript Garden](http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/)
* Finish up and submit [echo](https://github.com/advanced-js/echo) and [countdown](https://github.com/advanced-js/countdown) exercises
* Complete [blink](https://github.com/advanced-js/blink) exercise


## Pairing Tips

* Three people is possible, but two works best
* Agree on an editor and environment that you're both comfortable with
* Course standard is PyCharm from JetBrains
* The person who's less experienced/comfortable should have more keyboard time
* Switch who's "driving" regularly
* Make sure to save the code and send it to both people

### Instructor

Reuse and building upon ideas or code are major parts of modern software development.  As a professional programmer you will never write anything from scratch.  This class is structured such that all solutions are public.  You are encouraged to learn from the work of your peers.  I won't hunt down people who are simply copying-and-pasting solutions, because without challenging themselves, they  are simply wasting their time and money taking this class.

Please respect the terms of use and/or license of any code you find, and if you reimplement or duplicate an algorithm or code from elsewhere, credit the original source with an inline comment.
